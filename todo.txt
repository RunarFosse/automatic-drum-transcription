# Implement new model architectures

# -> Implement groundbreaking transformer model

# Store non-overfitting model temporarily to test generality 

# Find and include all datasets
    # These include:
        - ENST
        - RBMA
        - MDB and MDB 2.0
        - Slakh
        - ...

# Perform training and testing over several datasets

# Create analysis notebooks for model performance and plotting
