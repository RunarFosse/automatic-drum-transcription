# Update GitHub repository with changed URL (!IMPORTANT FIX)
# Also fix thesis name in SADTP repository

# Directly point to figures (The RNN architecture, as seen in Figure X.XX)

# Added "(adapted from [XX])" for figures taken from other sources.

# Possibly go through and rephrase initial start of background

# After rephrasing:
    - Possibly add a figure, in Dataset study: specifically 2 bar charts
    - Figure 2.15, Pipeline example: Make my own
    - Figure 3.1, 3.3 and 3.6 could be remade, and simpler

# Todos for thesis: 
    # Explicit layer norm in transformer architecures.
