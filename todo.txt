# Problem to discuss:
    - Offset predictions, hallucinations (like the tapping in et√¶k 'n),
    - Location variance (Different prediction depending on start timeframe, i.e. snare prediction on frame 20 if starting prediction from 5, not 10)

# Todos for thesis: 

    # Mention that we do 5 instrument transcription. I'm not sure if this is mentioned but this is really important. !! Important

    # Explicit layer norm in transformer architecures.

    # Correctively distinguish the usage of "WE" and "I". !! Important
    
    # Maybe cite Zenodo for where to download each dataset?

    Remember to distinguish what has been done before.
    Be clear when saying "I've combined these techniques which have been done before".
    Distinguish own novel contributions with previous ones.

    Background should include a lot more information from methodology.
        - The task should be explained here
        - Explaining the spectrogram/mel-spectrogram, input data and labels
        - The postprocessing, peak-picking algorithm should be here
        - Everything about performance measures should be here
        - Maybe something about previous architectures here aswell
    
    Methods should explain what I've done, not necessarily why or where stuff comes from.
    
    - Mention the size of each of the data
        - I.e. Waveform = (1, sr * seconds)
               Spectrogram = (frequencies, sr * second / hop_length)
               etc.
