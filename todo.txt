# Mention explicit 'Transfer Gap' in OOD datasets

# Ensure Dataset summary matches everything

# Fix 'activations' plot !!!!! IMPORTANT

# Thesis:
     - Sustain instead of duration (Introduction)

     - Discretely-sampled, not valued (Background)
     - Aliasing figure, add "redundantly sufficient"
     - FFT, add "Regardless of a realistic sampling rate"
     - STFT, add "granularity" when talking about hop length
     - Loudness, remove "Similar to pitch", as it is not explained yet
     - Pitch filters, explain what a filter actually is
     - Sheet music, say that rest marks are "fixed-time pauses"

     - Replace, "inputs and outputs" with "inputs, and thus outputs" (Architecture)
     - Fix C in convolutional to other (it already means classes), could be set to K
     - Replace, "Deeper into the convolutional blocks we go.." with "the deeper we go with more convolutional blocks"
     - Replace, "Fixed size convolutional block" with "a fixed number of convolutional blocks"
     - Mention pretraining on large datasets for Vision Transformer
     - Mention that a patch embedding is not a sequence, only each element of this sequence
     
     - Fix "MedleyDB Drums" to "MDB Drums" (Datasets)
     - First state dataset name short, and long in parantheses if they exist
     - Mention more specifically that there might be some errors in SADTP

     - Change "transformation" to "transformation scheme" (Methodology)
     - Add missing "optimizer" in "With the choice by what to use"
     - For peak picking, mention where "the model relatively is most confident"
     - Remove mention of instrumentwise F1-score
     - Explicitly mention RayTune trials as being 1 model per 1 dataset

     - Mention generalization, thats what I am looking for (Architecture Study)
     - For CNN, mention explicitly that performance is moderate objectively, but poor relatively/comparatively
     - Better summary in discussion, or a bit longer at least
     - Also mention a bit of future steps here, maybe a bit deep too

     - Replace "both datasets" with "all datasets" (Dataset Study)
     - Instead of evaluation on "remaining dataset", specify "test splits of all datasets"
     - Possibly add a figure, but this has to be last
     - Mention "transfer gap"
     - Fix a bit of E-GMD, notably OOD on E-GMD now being "easier" than previously
     - Mention how E-GMD is also distinctly and uniquely best when trained only on itsel
     - Replace MT3's "Offset F1" with "Onset F1", that is more correct
     - For comparison discussion, also name now E-GMD, newly added
     - Also mention how supplementing with other datasets increases on-distribution performance

     - Mention generalization! (Conclusion)

    - MDB Drums, not MDB-Drums (Appendix)




     



# Problem to discuss:
    - Offset predictions, hallucinations (like the tapping in et√¶k 'n),
    - Location variance (Different prediction depending on start timeframe, i.e. snare prediction on frame 20 if starting prediction from 5, not 10)

# Todos for thesis: 

    # Mention that we do 5 instrument transcription. I'm not sure if this is mentioned but this is really important. !! Important

    # Explicit layer norm in transformer architecures.

    # Correctively distinguish the usage of "WE" and "I". !! Important
    
    # Maybe cite Zenodo for where to download each dataset?

    ---
    Remember to distinguish what has been done before.
    Be clear when saying "I've combined these techniques which have been done before".
    Distinguish own novel contributions with previous ones.

    Background should include a lot more information from methodology.
        - The task should be explained here
        - Explaining the spectrogram/mel-spectrogram, input data and labels
        - The postprocessing, peak-picking algorithm should be here
        - Everything about performance measures should be here
        - Maybe something about previous architectures here aswell
    
    Methods should explain what I've done, not necessarily why or where stuff comes from.
    
    - Mention the size of each of the data
        - I.e. Waveform = (1, sr * seconds)
               Spectrogram = (frequencies, sr * second / hop_length)
               etc.
