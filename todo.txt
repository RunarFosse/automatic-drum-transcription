# Create analysis notebooks for model performance and plotting

# 100% Complete SADTP, by ensuring beats are not offset.
# - After this, finish zero-shot testing of all models.

# Todos for thesis: 

    # For all Architecture figures:

        - Add a flatten indication between convolutional/patch embedding and the remaining layers? !! Important

        - Figure out wether to explain hyperparameter values in-text, or as a separate table.

    Remember to distinguish what has been done before.
    Be clear when saying "I've combined these techniques which have been done before".
    Distinguish own novel contributions with previous ones.

    Background should include a lot more information from methodology.
        - The task should be explained here
        - Explaining the spectrogram/mel-spectrogram, input data and labels
        - The postprocessing, peak-picking algorithm should be here
        - Everything about performance measures should be here
        - Maybe something about previous architectures here aswell
    
    Methods should explain what I've done, not necessarily why or where stuff comes from.
    
    - Talk more about how we have to label the data
    - Mention why inaccurate labels are inevitable
    - Mention the size of each of the data
        - I.e. Waveform = (1, sr * seconds)
               Spectrogram = (frequencies, sr * second / hop_length)
               etc.

    Sort in order of experiments after methods:
    Methods -> Experiment 1 (Method -> Result -> Discussion) -> Experiment 2 (Method -> Result -> Discussion) -> Conclusion
