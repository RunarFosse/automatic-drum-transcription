# Update GitHub repository with changed URL (!IMPORTANT FIX)

# Thesis:
     - Mention generalization! (Conclusion)


# After rephrasing:
    - Possibly add a figure, in Dataset study: specifically 2 bar charts
    - Figure 2.15, Pipeline example: Make my own
    - Figure 3.1, 3.3 and 3.6 could be remade, and simpler

# Add GitHub repository to Methodology

# Problem to discuss:
    - Offset predictions, hallucinations (like the tapping in et√¶k 'n),
    - Location variance (Different prediction depending on start timeframe, i.e. snare prediction on frame 20 if starting prediction from 5, not 10)

# Todos for thesis: 

    # Explicit layer norm in transformer architecures.

    # Correctively distinguish the usage of "WE" and "I". !! Important

    Remember to distinguish what has been done before.
    Be clear when saying "I've combined these techniques which have been done before".
    Distinguish own novel contributions with previous ones.
    
    Methods should explain what I've done, not necessarily why or where stuff comes from.
