        - MDB and MDB 2.0
        - Slakh
        - EGMD
        - ADTOS

# Perform training and testing over several datasets

# Create analysis notebooks for model performance and plotting

    Remember to distinguish what has been done before.
    Be clear when saying "I've combined these techniques which have been done before".
    Distinguish own novel contributions with previous ones.

    Background should include a lot more information from methodology.
        - The task should be explained here
        - Explaining the spectrogram/mel-spectrogram, input data and labels
        - The postprocessing, peak-picking algorithm should be here
        - Everything about performance measures should be here
        - Maybe something about previous architectures here aswell
    
    Methods should explain what I've done, not necessarily why or where stuff comes from.
    

    Sort in order of experiments after methods:
    Methods -> Experiment 1 (Method -> Result -> Discussion) -> Experiment 2 (Method -> Result -> Discussion) -> Experiment 3? -> Conclusion
