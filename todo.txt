    Remember to distinguish what has been done before.
    Be clear when saying "I've combined these techniques which have been done before".
    Distinguish own novel contributions with previous ones.

    Sort in order of experiments after methods:
    Methods -> Experiment 1 (Method -> Result -> Discussion) -> Experiment 2 (Method -> Result -> Discussion) -> Experiment 3? -> Conclusion
