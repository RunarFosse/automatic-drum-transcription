# Create analysis notebooks for model performance and plotting

# Remove ADTOF from Convolutional RNN and Transformer model as they no longer are the same.

# Mention ADOTF-YT format correctly, as they state in their paper they are using log-spectrograms, but mel-spectrograms on Zenodo

# Problem to discuss:
    - Offset predictions, hallucinations (like the tapping in etÃ¦k 'n),
    - Location variance (Different prediction depending on start timeframe, i.e. snare prediction on frame 20 if starting prediction from 5, not 10)

# Todos for thesis: 

    # Mention that we do 5 instrument transcription. I'm not sure if this is mentioned but this is really important. !! Important

    # For all Architecture figures:

        - Add a flatten indication between convolutional/patch embedding and the remaining layers? !! Important

        - Figure out wether to explain hyperparameter values in-text, or as a separate table. (If moving, rewrite implementation details)

    # Explicit layer norm in transformer architecures.

    # Correctively distinguish the usage of "WE" and "I". !! Important

    # Verify that "et al." is only used with three or more authors!

    # Clean up bibliography, citing journals instead of arXiv if they are published.
    
    # Maybe cite Zenodo for where to download each dataset?

    Remember to distinguish what has been done before.
    Be clear when saying "I've combined these techniques which have been done before".
    Distinguish own novel contributions with previous ones.

    Background should include a lot more information from methodology.
        - The task should be explained here
        - Explaining the spectrogram/mel-spectrogram, input data and labels
        - The postprocessing, peak-picking algorithm should be here
        - Everything about performance measures should be here
        - Maybe something about previous architectures here aswell
    
    Methods should explain what I've done, not necessarily why or where stuff comes from.
    
    - Talk more about how we have to label the data
    - Mention why inaccurate labels are inevitable
    - Mention the size of each of the data
        - I.e. Waveform = (1, sr * seconds)
               Spectrogram = (frequencies, sr * second / hop_length)
               etc.

    Sort in order of experiments after methods:
    Methods -> Experiment 1 (Method -> Result -> Discussion) -> Experiment 2 (Method -> Result -> Discussion) -> Conclusion
