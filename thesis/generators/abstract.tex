\noindent \acrfull{ADT} remains a challenging task within the field of \acrfull{MIR}, especially when drum sounds are mixed with melodic instruments, otherwise called \acrfull{DTM}. The current standard methodology for solving such tasks is through deep learning. This thesis investigates how different architectures and dataset composition affect \acrshort{ADT} performance. Two studies were conducted: one comparing the performances of five different neural network architectures over four standard \acrshort{ADT} datasets, and another evaluating how training models on different dataset combinations impacts their generalization ability both on- and \acrfull{OOD}. A novel dataset, SADTP, is introduced for this latter study is utilized for \acrshort{OOD} evaluation. The first study concluded convolutional recurrent architectures perform the best across datasets, however strictly recurrent architectures and the Vision Transformer show promising performance on larger datasets. The second study shows that training on large and diverse datasets from multiple sources could improve both on- and \acrfull{OOD} generalization. These findings offer insight into how architecural and dataset choices influence generalization for \acrshort{ADT}.

	I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor Pekka Parviainen, for allowing me to choose my own master thesis subject, for always being available, both physically and digitally, as well as for his continuous support and guidance throughout the year. I also want to thank the University of Bergen, specifically the Institute of Informatics, for their provision of computational resources like Birget. Lastly, I want to thank everyone who have shown excitement and engagement into my master thesis topic, something which undeniably has helped me through this last part of my studies.
