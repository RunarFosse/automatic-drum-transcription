\chapter{Introduction}

Provide an introduction into the master thesis, \gls{AMT}, \gls{ADT} and mention why deep learning is suited for such a task.

\section{Background}

Mention some more detailed background into \gls{ADT}, \gls{DTM}, etc.
Mention some more details into how it started, how it is going, etc.
Also why this is of interest. (Maybe also what is missing)

\section{Thesis statement}

Present the aim of the thesis here. And the \b{questions!}
How do we train a model capable of solving such a task at a high performing level. More specifically:

What architectures are suited for learning such a task?
What datasets / combination of datasets makes the model generalize best?
Of the many techniques made to help models learn this task, which ones actually help? (Ablation)

\textbf{Remember the concrete \underline{What do we want to figure out}.}
