\chapter{Architecture Study}

This study's main purpose is to figure out how suited each architecture is for \gls{ADT}, more specifically \gls{DTM} tasks. This could help us figure out which architecture is superiour for \gls{ADT}, if there are any similarities between architectures who perform similarly well, or if there are any architectures who perform poorly.

\section{Methodology}

We perform hyperparameter tuning and model selection to train a separate model for each architecture over each dataset. At last we test the model on each dataset's respective test split. As a result, we are left with performance measures on unseen data from the same distribution as those each model was train on. This will give us a good intuition into each architecture's ability to learn the task of \gls{ADT} and could help us estimate their generalization ability.
