\chapter{Architecture Study}

\section{Methodology}

This study's main goal train different architectures over different \gls{ADT} datasets, and figure out if there exists any architecture which outperforms the other on the majority. This could answer the question; "Is there an architecture which is superiour when it comes to \gls{ADT} related tasks?". \textcolor{red}{For example. Some kind of introduction to the study more or less.}

\section{Results}
