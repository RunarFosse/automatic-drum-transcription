The ENST-Drums dataset by Gillet et al.~\cite{gillet_2006_7432188} has become a staple dataset within \gls{ADT}. \textcolor{red}{etc. etc. etc.}

The same can be said for the MedleyDB Drums dataset, from Southall et al.~\cite{southall2017mdb}. This dataset is built on top of Bittner et al.'s MedleyDB dataset~\cite{rachel_bittner_2014_1438309}, but re-annotated and specialized for \gls{ADT} related tasks.

Due to the small size of these two datasets, they are in this thesis combined into one. \textcolor{red}{etc. etc. etc.}
