\section{ENST+MDB}

The ENST-Drums dataset by Gillet et al.~\cite{gillet_2006_7432188} has been one of the most commonly used \gls{ADT} datasets~\cite{8350302}. It is comprised of drum kit recordings, with a thorough ground-truth annotation.  \textcolor{red}{etc. etc. etc.}

The same can be said for the MedleyDB Drums dataset, from Southall et al.~\cite{southall2017mdb}. This dataset is built on top of Bittner et al.'s MedleyDB dataset~\cite{rachel_bittner_2014_1438309}, but re-annotated and specialized for \gls{ADT} related tasks.

Due to the small size of these two datasets, they are in this thesis combined into one. \textcolor{red}{etc. etc. etc.}

\section{SADTP}

The SADTP (Small Automatic Drum Transcription Performance) dataset is a novel dataset introduced in this thesis. It is a small dataset comprised of 16 songs with corresponding MIDI transcriptions. The \textit{performance} name alludes to the transcription being recorded live while listening to the songs on playback, with only minor post-processing. The transcriptions were recorded on a Roland TD-11 electric drumset, recording the MIDI perfomance to Apple's Garageband, and extracting them to separate MIDI files.

The dataset contains 1.08 hours of music, which can be split into 977 non-overlapping 4 second datapoints (includes zero padding certain pieces for even partitioning).
