\textcolor{red}{Mention the different already existing datasets used and information about them.}

\section{ENST-Drums + MDB Drums}

\gls{ENST} by Gillet et al.~\cite{gillet_2006_7432188} has become a staple dataset within \gls{ADT}. 

The same can be said for \gls{MDB}, from Southall et al.~\cite{southall2017mdb}. This dataset is built on top of Bittner et al.'s MedleyDB dataset~\cite{rachel_bittner_2014_1438309}, but re-annotated and specialized for \gls{ADT} related tasks.

Due to the small size of these two datasets, they are in this thesis combined into one.
