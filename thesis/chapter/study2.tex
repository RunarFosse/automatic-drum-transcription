\chapter{Dataset Study}

This study's main purpose is to figure out how each dataset, and their characteristics, combined can influence a model's performance, both on and out-of-distribution. This could help us figure out how to utilize and combine current datasets, or how to intelligently construct future datasets, to optimize models' performance and generalization ability for \acrfull{ADT} and \acrfull{DTM}.

\section{Methodology}

We train convolutional recurrent neural networks, the best performing architecture from the first study, over several different combinations of the first four datasets ENST+MDB, E-GMD, Slakh, and ADTOF-YT. Datasets are combined as a union, where one epoch over the combined dataset would be equivalent to one epoch of both datasets separately. Each model is also evaluated on the remaining datasets, in addition to the SADPT dataset.

The number of different combination of datasets \textcolor{red}{(explain why we have a subset of combinations, and how they were selected.)}
